# Film Finder
A movie database search tool built using [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and powered by the [Open Movie Database](http://omdbapi.com/).

**Note:** This tool needs a functioning API key for the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) API.

## Usage
Clone the repo and serve the root directory using any web server.

You can check out [the demo](http://www.blrice.net/film_finder/), but functionality is limited due to a missing API key.
